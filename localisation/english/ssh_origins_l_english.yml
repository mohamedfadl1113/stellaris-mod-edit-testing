 origin_ssh_shellworld: "The Shell Above"
 origin_ssh_shellworld_desc: "For millenia, this civilization has evolved on a rocky world, illuminated by giant artificial lights in the sky above. Always wondering what the purpose of the giant pillar-like structures on the surface was, they have recently had the technological breakthrough necessary to find out these are, in fact, ancient elevators built by unknown precursors that lead to an artificial world in the skies. Now they are finally capable of powering up these machines, make use of the vast size of the shell - and grasp the cosmos."

 origin_ssh_gas_giant_shellworld_desc: "For millenia, this civilization has evolved in an idyllic, perfectly shaped environment. They have recently discovered the two huge glass domes on the poles of the planet - and the beautiful view on the gas giant below. Now they have discovered the technology necessary to make use of the giant - and use it to grasp the stars."

 origin_ssh_stellar_hoop: "Starborne"
 origin_ssh_stellar_hoop_desc: "This machine intelligence was born as an AI-System on an artificial structure that reaches deep into the system's star's photosphere. Its creators had managed to create ultra-heat resistant alloys and harvest the star's energy from inside the photosphere, but due to the hostile environment they transferred the AI into synthetic bodies to maintain the structure. It's unknown what happened to them, but their former homeworld and only non-mined planet in the system suggests their homeworld experienced a tectonical catastrophe that wiped out all life on the planet - however, that was many intervals before the AI gained consciousness."

 origin_ssh_edersphere: "Ederbubble"
 origin_ssh_edersphere_desc: "This civilization has evolved on an artificial habitat three times the size of an average gas giant - a huge sphere filled with vast amounts of hydrogen gas. \nThey have lived inside the unknown precursor shell for millenia and only a few centuries ago have found the first tunnels leading to hangars on the outside. They have studied the complex construction of the different parts of some of the spaceship wreckage for more than a century, and by collecting scrap equipment and unused machinery, they are now able to use their knowledge to repair some of the few FTL-Drives."

 origin_ssh_hoopworld: "Round Earth Theory"
 origin_ssh_hoopworld_desc: "This civilization has debated about the shape of their planet for millenia - some say it's egg shaped, some say it's flat, and others say it's spherical. Only recently have they developed the technology necessary to conquer the freezing 'poles' of their planet - and see the giant hoop rise in the sky above them. Turns out their planet isn't shaped like anything they had imagined - it's a donut shaped planet! With this knowledge, they have been able to achieve fitting space travel relatively fast, and now they are finally ready to test their first FTL drive."

 origin_ssh_freesphere: "Freefall Utopia"
 origin_ssh_freesphere_desc: "Over millenia, this civilization has evolved in an idyllic freefall environment inside a giant artificial bubble created by unknown precursors. Instead of walking, inhabitants inside such environments use their wings or fins to 'fly' around. Thousands of floating islands made up of either water or soil serve as their homes, allowing a diverse flora and fauna to evolve over time."

 origin_ssh_habitable_dyson_desc: "This civilization has evolved on the surface of a heavily modified Dyson Sphere. \nWhatever happened to the creators of the structure is unknown to them, but they have studied the complex construction for millenia and only recently have they managed to finally achieve their technological breakthrough in FTL-technology. By collecting and repurposing scrap and other unused machinery, they are now able to use their knowledge along with their limitless energy supply to reach the stars."

 ssh_origin.2.name: "The Outer World"
 ssh_origin.2.desc: "For millenia, our people have looked up in the dark skies, philosophizing about the large beams of light that shine down onto the surface. \nThere are also the mysterious pillars that spread around our homeworld that rise from the surface to above the sky - wars have been fought over them, and religions centered around them have spread and passed. \n\nBut now we know their real purpose. \n\nUnknown precursors must have constructed these pillars as some sort of elevator to a whole new world above the skies - a bright, colorful and perfectly shaped landscape. \nWhile we don't understand how such a construction is physically possible yet, we most certainly will in the future. \n\nIn the meantime, it is time for us to make use of the new vast amounts of land, and grasp the stars - this time, the real ones."
