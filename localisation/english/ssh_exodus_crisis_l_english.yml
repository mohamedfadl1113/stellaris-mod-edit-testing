Interrogations suggest that The Shroud appears to be inhabited by a vast variety of entities unlike any forms of life we have known so far. There seems to be no spatial 'barrier' to The Shroud; it might very well stretch over infinite distances, depending on the concentration of sentient beings in nearby regions. It might be impossible for us to access its deepest regions, but perhaps we don't even need to. The amount of information we have gained so far about The Shroud already gives us a good understanding of how the realm works.

In one of them, we could measure an insanely high concentration of pure energy, while another realm immediately dissipated any incoming sensor signals. Unlike The Shroud, these other realms do not seem to be directly connected to sapient minds. However, our research suggests that it could be possible to establish a physical connection to most of them - this process could already be observed happening naturally in form of so-called Astral Rifts. Additionally, we confirmed that each dimension contains some form of individual dimensional 'energy,' allowing us to better distinguish them and sort them in a rough order. Most importantly, we were able to modify our initial mathematical theory with these insights, which now applies true to each of these realms. \n\nWhile these realms exhibit a wide variety of behaviors and slight variations in physical laws, the underlying logic remains essentially the same: they all follow the law of conservation of energy, and basic logic applies everywhere. Thus, they are not mutually self-destructive, and the inhabitants of any given realm can theoretically cross to any other realm. While the physical properties of these realms might be hostile to them, the fundamental principles of existence remain the same across all realms. \n\nThough our realm is one of many, we can categorize these other realms into a few 'layers.' All of these dimensions exist within one fundamental 'super-realm,' which forms the foundation or clockwork of reality. If we were able to somehow access or even fully move to this fundamental realm, we would be freed from the shackles of resource struggles and ideological conflicts. If we learned how to adapt to this dimension, we could tamper with reality as we wish and make the universe our playground."

However, our scientific models suggest that if multiple different astral rifts were to connect different dimensions at a single spot, their 'tunnels' could collide with each other, breaking down in one location and thereby directly leading into The Fundament. Normally, this would cause an immediate collapse of the Rift due to the hyperdimensional energies of The Fundament pressuring against the open gateway, but if we were to infuse the broken-down gateway with gargantuan amounts of raw energy, this 'counter-flow' could temporarily stabilize the rift. During that short time span, we could enter The Fundament, although the extreme energies would definitely destroy our physical bodies. That won't be an issue, though, as inhabitants of The Fundament don't need physical bodies to survive in their environment. From the moment we enter the realm, our people will become something similar to Shroud-Entities, only far more powerful.
