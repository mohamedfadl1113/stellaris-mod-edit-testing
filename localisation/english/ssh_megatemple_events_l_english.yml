 ssh_megatemple.2.a.text: "§rThe Shroud§!, also known as the §YShallow Shroud§! or §YVadunrum§!, is a realm of pure psionic energy that naturally congregates around concentrations of sapient neural networks. Therefore, there exists not only 'the one' Shroud, but instead a lot of 'smaller' Shrouds forming some sort of 'clusters' around galaxies that inhabit a sufficient amount of sapient life - the larger a local group of psionic individuals is, the more the Shroud 'attaches' to them. The physical barrier between Real Space and the Shroud appears to be dynamic, it can be altered through various means and great efforts. One example where 'fluctuations' or 'resonances' in the barrier can be felt by psionics, even if only barely, are massive galactic objects and events that form heavy subspace eruptions, notably black holes and supernovae. Whenever such subspace eruptions are actively being observed, they provide some sort of temporary 'valley' in the barrier. Even though naturally these fluctuations are minimal, the perception of such resonances can be enhanced through mind-altering substances like §BZro§!. The higher the dose of Zro in a highly skilled psionic individual, the easier it is for them to access the local Shroud - if they manage to withstand the side-effects, which include delusions, hallucinations, unconsciousness or even death. \nIn general, the more focused and stimulated a sapient being's mind is, e.g. the more creative they are or the stronger their emotions are, the stronger the local Shroud 'attaches' to it. \n\nDepending on the skill of any individual that awakened their psionic potential, the Shroud may be manipulated in various ways, allowing seemingly physics-defying abilities; most widespread telepathy. The Shroud hosts diverse entities made up by raw psionic energies, some of which appear to be extremely powerful. Even though the Shrouds of different galaxies are usually mostly isolated from one another, they can occasionally through large, intergalactic 'Shallow Shroud Tendrils'."

 ssh_megatemple.2.b.text: "The §SAbyssal Anchor§! is a massive mega-temple constructed around the most extreme galactic objects, like black holes. It is a residential place for highly skilled psionics, offering them large halls for prayers and meditation sessions. It also pumps in and filters large amounts of Zro particles from around the galactic object it is constructed around, permanently exposing any individual inside to high doses of Zro, sparking their imagination, making them more resistant to its side-effects over time and improving their abilities to sense the Shroud resonances of the violent subspace disruptions near the event horizon. \n\nIt makes use of the three layers and each layers connection to the respective other ones - Real Space, the Mind and the Shroud: \nThe Real Space area near the temple already offers a higher potential for any Shroud activities due to the violent subspace region. \nOne the one hand, The Mind, since there must be a group of sentient observers for a Shroud to form, is stimulated by the stunning view on the black hole and its Zro accretion disk below. On the other hand, the effects of the constant high doses of Zro enable the psionic residents to experience and feel the Shroud resonances more intensely over time. \n\nTherefore, the Abyssal Anchor is the perfect place for deep ventures into the Shroud, as it makes use of as many phenomena known to us that strengthen Shroud interactions as possible."

 ssh_megatemple.2.c.text: "By infusing lots of Zro into a star, the minimal shroud resonances caused by its violent fusion process and solar storms seem to increase slightly and, more importantly, 'destabilize' the star a bit. This destabilization is only minimal, naturally it wouldn't have any notable influence on the star in any way, but if the star were to be highly unstable already, this effect could be exploited to push the star over the critical limit and detonate it, violently releasing all its Zro-charged energy through massive subspace waves. \nIf any group of psionic observers large enough to form a relatively stable local Shroud would be close enough to observe such events, they might be able to enter the Shroud in the right moment to take the momentum of this 'psi-wave' and fling their Shroud along the wave into distances that would have never been deemed possible until recently. \nOur scientists found a way of destabilizing regular stars by exploiting the gravitational instability between their outer and inner pressure: It is possible to shift the balance of pressure by scooping away a star's outer layers, tremendously decreasing the outer gravitational pressure pushing against the fusion inside its core. The Zro-amplified destabilization could then give the star the final push and detonate it. \n\nThis already would be an expensive task, but being so close to a supernova is incredibly dangerous, plus observing one from such a short distance would most certainly blind any observer. \n\nTo make sure that we can safely monitor what the observers see and return with the gained information, we must be at a safe place without the risk of death. \nThis is where our high priests come into play - the §YAbyssal Anchor§! allows us relatively stable deep ventures into the Shroud on a regular basis, and depending on the psionic skills of two telepaths and how deep they can access the Shroud, the distances over which they can establish a short-timed, but somewhat stable telepathic connection can greatly increase during the time in the Shroud. \n\nUsing all this information, our research team proposes that we could developed a feasible method of removing a star's outer layers while infusing it with Zro. Before pushing it over its limits, a science ship with a group of skilled psionics could then be sent into the system to watch the event unfold, while the moment they venture into the Shroud to be taken along the psi-wave our telepaths inside the Abyssal Anchor enter the deeper Shroud regions to establish a telepathic connection to them.§! \nIf successful, they might be able to witness and report what our team near the supernova experiences on their journey to regions unknown."

 #### FLING SHROUD TENTACLE ####
 ssh_megatemple.7.desc: "We can use a §YZro-Detonator§! to shift the balance of pressure within a star and infuse it with Zro, destabilizing it and finally making it explode in a §rPsi-Supernova§!. \nWe will send a group of skilled psionics near the star and make them watch the event unfold and enter the Shroud at the right time to 'slide' along the enourmous subspace wave, which creates a temporary §B'Shroud-Tendril'§! that flings far into the distance, possibly outside the galaxy. By establishing a strong telepathic connection from the Abyssal Anchor to them through the deeper parts of the Shroud, we can try to monitor and witness what they experience. \n\n§PHowever, we have no idea what lies out there and what me may encounter - the risks could be great, but the insights we might gain could be worth the risks.§! \n\nShall we proceed?"
 ssh_megatemple.7.a: "Confirm."
 ssh_megatemple.7.a.tooltip: "We require a completed §YZro Detonator§! around any star within our borders and a §Yscience ship§! with a §rpsionic leader§! in its system!"
 ssh_megatemple.7.b: "Go Back."

 ssh_megatemple.8.desc: "Before starting the mission, we have to choose a system containing a §YZro Detonator§!. \n\nAgain, possible risks may include §Punpredictable§! §rShroud Insights§! as well as §Pharm or even death§! of the psionic observers near the supernova!§!"

 ssh_megatemple.8.b: "We are not ready yet."

 ssh_megatemple.9.desc: "As our telepaths enter the Shroud, a massive psionic eruption takes them along. \n\nMillions of tiny bright stars flash by as they approach the outer rim of the galaxy, away from its core at an insane speed - §Yand then, darkness§!. \n\nLooking behind, we witness our galaxy becoming smaller and smaller as we enter intergalactic space. We fly aimless deeper into the vast void. \n\n§YUntil we notice a bright light rapidly approaching.§!"
 ssh_megatemple.9.a: "§YWhat do you see?§!"
