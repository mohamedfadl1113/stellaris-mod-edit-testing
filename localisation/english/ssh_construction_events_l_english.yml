 ssh_cn.33.a: "Keep the structure."
 ssh_cn.33.b: "Dismantle it."

 ssh_cn.41.name: "Brown Dwarf Ignited!"
 ssh_cn.41.desc: "We have successfully turned [From.Planet.GetName] into a §Hstar§!! \n\nThe fusion chain reaction is finally stable and the former brown dwarf now shines bright. \n\nThe heat it's emitting has also damaged our megastructure, parts of which have therefore crashed into the star and have more or less completed their task by serving as some fuel."
