 resolution_category_ssh_megaconstruction: "Megaconstruction"
 
 resolution_megaconstruction_streamlined_protocols: "Streamlined Megaconstruction Protocols"
 resolution_megaconstruction_streamlined_protocols_desc: "Megastructures offer the potential of resource extraction on an entirely new scale. We should introduce a common construction standard to ease the construction process of such structures."
 resolution_megaconstruction_megastructure_subsidies: "Megastructure Subsidies"
 resolution_megaconstruction_megastructure_subsidies_desc: "Much potential lies in megastructures, be it for housing, resource extraction or other aspects. We should encourage the construction of such wonders."
 resolution_megaconstruction_architecural_renaissance: "Architectural Renaissance"
 resolution_megaconstruction_architecural_renaissance_desc: "Megastructures are rightfully regarded as the wonders of our time. Everybody should profit from the benefits and potential which megastructures provide."
 resolution_megaconstruction_architecural_renaissance_tt: "Unlocks the §Y$tech_mega_engineering$§! Technology for all Galactic Community Members."
 resolution_megaconstruction_extraction_initiative: "Megascale Extraction Initiative"
 resolution_megaconstruction_extraction_initiative_desc: "The amount of resources megastructures can extract from celestial bodies is immense. Perhaps a future awaits us where the dangerous work in mines has become obsolete?"

Technologies for all Galactic Community Members. \n- Construction cost of §YNanite Disassemblers§! reduced by §H50%§! \n- Chance for the §Y$ssh_tech_system_disintegrator$§! Technology appearing increased by §H50%§!"
