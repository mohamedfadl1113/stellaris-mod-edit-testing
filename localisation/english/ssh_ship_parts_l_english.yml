 ### SHIP PARTS ###
 ##################
 ARMOR_CULTROBIUM: "Cultrobium Armor"
 ARMOR_CULTROBIUM_DESC: "Cultrobium is a Customized Ultra-Robust element which does not appear in nature. It is made up of artificially created ultra-strong atoms and therefore immensely durable and resistant, which makes it great for ship armor."

 AUTO_REPAIR_CONMAT: "Living Hull Repair System"
 AUTO_REPAIR_CONMAT_DESC: "Gene-Modified Conscious Matter can replace a part of our ship's hull. It is sapient and therefore regenerates any damage to its body at ludicrous speeds."

 # SPECIAL COMPUTERS
 SSH_CAPTIVE_STAR_COMPUTER: "Stellar Processor"

 SSH_DARK_MATTER_MISSILE_COMPUTER_DESC: "The warhead's computer controls the trigger to ensure the weapon doesn't detonate on accident."

 # Hyperdrives
 INTERDIMENSIONAL_JUMP_DRIVE_1: "Interdimensional Jump Drive"
 INTERDIMENSIONAL_JUMP_DRIVE_1_DESC: "Incredibly complex combinations of contained quantum entanglements allow for short-term breaches in the fabric of spacetime itself, enabling us to temporarily reach into higher dimensions - that is, of course, if we were to provide the vast amounts of energy and dark matter required by this process."

 # Reactors
 REACTOR_CAPTIVE_STAR: "Captive Star"
 REACTOR_CAPTIVE_STAR_DESC: "The emitted radiation and heat from the star are used to power the sphere's thrusters."

 REACTOR_DARK_MATTER_MISSILE: "Warhead Battery"
 REACTOR_DARK_MATTER_MISSILE_DESC: "The missile is powered by tapping a small quantity of the dark matter warhead's contained energy."

 # Thrusters
 THRUSTER_CAPTIVE_STAR: "Stellar Thrusters"
 THRUSTER_CAPTIVE_STAR_DESC: "The emissions from the star are focused in a strong lense, artificially accelerated and exhausted to propel the celestial vessel. Due to the massive size of the ship, it's difficult to enter subspace, rendering jump drives less efficient."

 THRUSTER_DARK_MATTER_MISSILE: "Missile Thrusters"
 THRUSTER_DARK_MATTER_MISSILE_DESC: "The thrusters allow the warhead to travel between systems, even though they are quite slow."

 # SYSTEM KILLERS
 SYSTEM_KILLER_CAPTIVE_STAR: "Star"
 SYSTEM_KILLER_CAPTIVE_STAR_DESC: "Once we collide this celestial body with another star, the resulting fusion of both objects will result in a massive supernova, annihilating the entire solar system surrounding them."
 
 SYSTEM_KILLER_DARK_WMD: "Dark Warhead"
 SYSTEM_KILLER_DARK_WMD_DESC: "An immensely powerful warhead that draws its energy directly from dark matter, releasing more energy than should be possible according to the laws of physics when detonated."
 SYSTEM_KILLER_DARK_WMD_LARGE: "Large Dark Warhead"
 SYSTEM_KILLER_DARK_WMD_LARGE_DESC: "An even more powerful warhead that draws its energy directly from a huge concentration of dark matter, releasing an unimaginable amount of energy when detonated."

 SYSTEM_KILLER_BRAIN_MAW: "Apex Brain Absorber"
 SYSTEM_KILLER_BRAIN_MAW_DESC: "Whatever touches the tissue of the brain is immediately absorbed into its behemoth belly. It has grown enough to even consume the stars themselves."
