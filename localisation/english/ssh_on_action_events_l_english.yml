 ### Other On Actions 
 ssh_action.2.name: "Colony Devoured By Nanites!"
 ssh_action.2.desc: "Terrible news reach us that our colony [From.Planet.GetName] has been devoured by nanites! \nEvery last piece of the planet's biosphere and our population there has been transformed into more self-replicating nanobots, which now lay deactivated on the planet's surface! \nThere's no way to recover the colony."
 ssh_action.2.a: "Terrible!"

 ssh_action.3.name: "Planet Devoured By Nanites"
 ssh_action.3.desc: "We have finished our orbital bombardment of [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nOur nanites have fully transformed every last bit of the planet's population and biosphere, and all that's left is a surface covered in inactive nanites."

 ssh_action.5.name: "Planetary Megastructure Destroyed"
 ssh_action.5.desc: "We have finished our orbital bombardment of [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nThe heavy damage the structure has taken has caused it collapse on itself. \nAll that's left of the colony is destroyed debris."

 ssh_action.6.name: "Shellworld Destroyed!"
 ssh_action.6.desc: "Our shellworld above [From.Planet.GetName] has been destroyed! \n\nThe heavy damage the structure has taken from ongoing [From.GetAdj] bombardment has caused it collapse on itself! \nMost of its parts have crashed on the planet below, rendering it mostly uninhabitable. \n\nWhile we are still able to restore the shellworld, all that's left of the colony is destroyed debris."

 ssh_action.7.name: "Edersphere Destroyed!"
 ssh_action.7.desc: "Our Edersphere in the [From.System.GetName] system has been destroyed! \n\nThe heavy orbital bombardment damage the structure has taken from the ongoing [From.GetAdj] bombardment has caused it collapse on itself! \n\nMost of the hydrogen has escaped the sphere and most of the shell is gone. \n\nWhile we are still able to restore the Edersphere, all that's left of the colony is destroyed debris."

 #Ruined Mega Systems
 ssh_action.10.name: "Ruined Shellworlds"
 ssh_action.10.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our scientists were stunned to find two huge shellworlds!  \n\nThey seem to have taken heavy damage though and their former owners must have left them a long time ago, probably because of their star turning into a huge red giant. \nIf we would have the technology to restore such megastructures we could easily repair them and colonize them again. \n\nThis system could prove to be useful in the future."
 ssh_action.10.a: "Acknowledged."

 ssh_action.11.name: "Ruined Edersphere"
 ssh_action.11.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our scientists were stunned to find a giant artificial sphere orbiting the black hole instead of planets! \n\nThe sphere is heavily damaged, and our scientists assume this was caused by the system's star collapsing into a black hole a long time ago. \nThey think it was used as a giant planet-like habitat filled with hydrogen gas instead of a natural core. \nWe could probably easily repair it in the future if we were to posess such an advanced technology by then. \n\nThis system could prove to be useful in the future."
 ssh_action.11.a: "Acknowledged."

 ssh_action.12.name: "Ruined Suprashell"
 ssh_action.12.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our scientists were wondering why the black hole's accretion disk isn't emitting any light. \n\nUpon closer inspection they were stunned to find out this is caused by a gargantuan artificial sphere constructed around the black hole! \n\nThe sphere is heavily damaged and most of it has fallen down beyond the event horizon over time, but our scientists assume it was used as an incredibly huge planet-like habitat that used the black hole's gravitational pull to generate gravity at its core. \nWhile such a technology is incredibly advanced and far beyond our engineering capabilities at the moment, we could probably repair the shell in the future if we were to posess such an advanced technology by then. \n\nThis system could prove to be very useful in the future."
 ssh_action.12.a: "Acknowledged."

 # Hoopworld Primitives
 ssh_action.13.name: "Torus Shaped Planet"
 ssh_action.13.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our scientists noticed something very odd. \n\nOne of the few system's planets turns out to be... shaped like a torus? \nChances of such planets appearing naturally are near zero, but not impossible. \nIndeed it is possible that if the torus has a uniform shape, its gravity balances so that it does not collapse toward the center. \n\nThis system definitely seems interesting enough to fully survey."
 ssh_action.13.a: "How odd."

 # Brain Leviathan
 ssh_action.101.name: "An Odd System"
 ssh_action.101.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our scientists were stunned to find out that every single system planet appears to have been utterly destroyed - except for one planet.

This marvel of engineering and computer science is still intact, with millions of inhabitants still linked to it. With our advanced knowledge about organic-machine interfaces, we could easily reverse-engineer the neural pods and keep the structure as is. However, we could also decide to shut down the computer and dismantle it - which would surely anger its creators and give us some beneficial engineering insights. The effect on the still linked pops would be fatal, however."
 ssh_action.70_02.desc: "With the capture of [horizon_brain.solar_system.GetName] the Horizon Brain megacomputer falls into our possession. The device is still intact, with millions of inhabitants still linked to it. Unfortunately we lack the knowledge about organic-machine interfaces, meaning we can't keep the structure running for much longer, nor safely disconnect the population inside. The only thing we can do is shut down the computer and dismantle it - which would surely anger its creators and give us some beneficial engineering insights. The effect on the still linked pops would be fatal, however."
 ssh_action.70.a: "Keep the structure!"
 ssh_action.70.b: "Locate the power button and dismantle the structure afterwards."
