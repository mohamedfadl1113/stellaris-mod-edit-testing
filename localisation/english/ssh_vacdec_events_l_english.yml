 ssh_on.44.name: "Unusual Particle Fields"
 ssh_on.44.desc: "As the §Y[From.GetName]§! System has been disintegrated and is being harvested, our sensors have picked up unusual readings occuring from the system: \nWhile our way of disintegrating matter is admittably pretty rough and therefore destabilizes the local quantum fields temporarily, these instabilities usually vanish a short while after the disintegration process. However, ever since §Y[From.GetName]§! has been disintegrated, the exotic particle fields created by the process have still not vanished - instead, they have begun to expand ever since. Our scientists' best suggestions are that these fields have somehow been stabilized - probably by an unfortunate alignment of local quantum fields inside the system during the disintegration process and the subsequent subspace quakes. Experts assured us that chances of such event happening are extremely low, yet still possible. \nBy now the expanding particle field has already crossed nearby systems, as it seems to travel through subspace. Luckily though, we can measure its intensity slowly decreasing the more it expands. It also does not seem to affect matter or energy, except for triggering a few of our science sensors due to the subspace fluctuations it causes. It will most likely reach far beyond the galactic rim before these fluctuations will become too weak to be measured, but our scientists tell us not to worry."

Do your primitive minds understand the gravity of the situation? No, of course not, why would they?! You can consider yourself incredibly lucky that your anomaly's effects decrease over time, but it will take a VERY LONG time until it can be called 'safe'!

It's hard to describe the exact feeling, but it resembles a sudden loss of control; the knowledge about them slipping out of 'reality' very soon. As soon as this feeling sets in in their dreams it always triggers a chain reaction, at first any [From.Species.GetName] near them stops noticing them as if they were a ghost, shortly after which their surrounding disappears and the dreamer finds themselves in an empty dark void which always causes them to immediately wake up. \n\nThere's an increasing amount of reports about such reoccuring dreams throughout the population, but we are unsure what exactly could cause this."

 ssh_vacdec.4.desc: "Breaking news reach us from our science department operating in the outer rim of the galaxy: The frequency and intensity of light measured by our tachyon sensors aimed at our neighboring galaxy has suddenly become weaker than it should actually be. To the naked eye, everything appears normal, and all of our conventional scientific instruments report the usual readings. Yet, for some reason, our tachyon sensors tell a different story, as if something unseen is shifting the light between our galaxies. Usually only colossal objects such as supermassive black holes could be able to bend the light that way, but our gravitational wave measurements show no increase in wave activity - quite the opposite, the intensity and frequency of gravitational waves occuring from our neighboring galaxy has actually started to rapidly decrease for some reason. \n\nWe are not sure what's out there causing these anomalies, but we are advised to keep an eye on them."

Even more unsettling is the fact that some of the signals we send in the direction of the anomaly have begun to dissipate. We can't get any more information about new changes as no signals return from the void, except for gravitational waves - or rather, the lack thereof. \nEver since we began measuring the rapid decrease in the frequency and intensity of gravitational waves, combined with the prism-like shift of light from our neighboring galaxy, our scientists have been scrambling to understand these phenomena. Yet, they have not come to any realistic conclusion so far. \n\nThe galaxy still appears as normal, as if everything were usual, but our scientific equipment tells a radically different story. Something from the void is approaching, and we must be prepared for whatever it may bring. \nCivilian vessels are strongly advised to avoid traveling through the outer rim until we can determine the cause of these equipment malfunctions."

 ssh_ark_jump_intro: "Upon entering the fourth dimension, the Ark's sensors went haywire. The higher-dimensional energies immediately began to press against the hull of the Ark, but fortunately, it was not crushed. For most crew members on board, the journey felt like the blink of an eye. However, those who tried to catch a glimpse of the outside environment were overwhelmed by what they saw. Some cheered, others began to cry, but most remained silent in disbelief. According to interrogation protocols, words cannot adequately describe what they witnessed, but many reported that an eternity seemed to pass between the start and the end of the journey from their perspective. \nAs the external pressure became too intense, the Ark exited the fourth dimension as swiftly as it had entered. Upon re-entering our native dimension, the warp bubble immediately collapsed, causing a massive subspace eruption that tore the Ark apart and catapulted its fragments into the void. Fortunately, our engineers had integrated an emergency system for such situation. This system automatically launched each segment of the habitation rings, inhabited by each participant, away from the debris and safely decelerated them. \nAfter a few days of recovery, we began constructing a starbase in this region of space. We also found some of the Ark's debris, which we are now looting for resources. According to our scientists, sensor data suggests that, as predicted, we are located in a region beyond the observable universe from the viewpoint of our old galaxy."

The Rift Generator utilises incredibly complex combinations of certain entangled elementary particles in a way that temporarily destabilizes the fabric of spacetime so much that it breaches a hole into it, providing a gateway into the fourth dimension. By traversing this higher dimension, our three dimensional space can be folded to an extend we never deemed possible, allowing us to carry over an almost infinite distance for a short amount of time.

These universes have only been used to store raw minerals due to their limited capacity and volatility - We will need a considerably larger realm to allow the heat inside the universe to distribute and stabilize it to prevent it from imploding under its own energy and heat. Aside from that, we must also be able to sever its connection to our universe after entering it to prevent the Vacuum Decay from spreading there. Furthermore, the new universe must contain a balanced mix of elements to foster the formation of stars, planets, and eventually habitable worlds.

 ### Probing various celestial bodies
 ssh_vacdec.602.name: "Probing Results"
 ssh_vacdec.602.desc: "We have successfully completed our experiments conducted near a black hole. Our scientists confirm that the immense gravitational field of the black hole makes it significantly easier to bend spacetime with minimal energy input. The black hole's natural curvature of spacetime provides a unique advantage in this regard, drastically reducing the power required to manipulate the fabric of our universe. \nHowever, despite this advantage, the lack of significant radiation and heat emissions from the black hole presents a critical challenge. The creation of a stable Basement Universe requires a substantial amount of heat and energy to facilitate the expansion and stabilization of the new realm. Unfortunately, the environment near the black hole is insufficient in providing these necessary conditions. \nTherefore, while the gravitational properties of the black hole are beneficial for spacetime manipulation, its inability to supply adequate heat and radiation renders it unsuitable for the creation of a Basement Universe. \n\nWe should continue our search and conduct further experiments near other stellar candidates to find a more viable location."

 ssh_vacdec.603.name: "Probing Results"
 ssh_vacdec.603.desc: "We have successfully completed our experiments conducted near a neutron star. Neutron stars, while inherently dangerous due to their intense radiation, could present a unique opportunity for the creation of a Basement Universe. Firstly, neutron stars generate immense gravitational forces, significantly warping the surrounding spacetime. This substantial curvature can potentially reduce the energy requirements for manipulating and stabilizing a Basement Universe, making it an attractive candidate from a gravitational perspective. However, the intense radiation emitted by neutron stars poses severe risks to both biological and synthetic life. The energy output from neutron stars differs from that of conventional stars, as it primarily consists of high-energy radiation rather than the heat typically harnessed for expansion processes. This type of radiation is less ideal for directly heating and expanding a Basement Universe. Since the polar regions of neutron stars - and especially those of pulsars - emit incredibly focused beams of high-energy radiation, our scientists propose that by strategically aligning and redirecting these gamma-ray bursts into the Basement Universe, we could leverage their intense energy to facilitate expansion. Additionally, these beams could transport heavy elements from the star's core directly into the Basement Universe, aiding in the formation of essential matter for planetary development. Even though such stars' environment is extremely hazardous and not ideal for the creation of a basement realm, their ability to significantly warp spacetime and the potential to utilize their gamma-ray bursts could make them a viable candidate. \n\nFurther research and careful planning will be necessary to harness these unique properties safely, but the possibilities are encouraging."

 ssh_vacdec.604.name: "Probing Results"
 ssh_vacdec.604.desc: "We have successfully completed our experiments conducted near a regular-class star. Our scientists confirm that the immense heat and radiation emitted by the star are highly beneficial for the creation of a Basement Universe. The star's continuous energy output provides an ideal source of heat, which is crucial for expanding and stabilizing the new realm. This energy could be directly channeled into the Basement Universe, promoting its growth and preventing it from collapsing under its own pressure. \nHowever, regular stars present a significant drawback: even the most massive ones' gravitational influence is relatively weak and does not provide the necessary spacetime curvature needed for efficient manipulation. The minimal warping of spacetime around the star means that the energy required to create and sustain a Basement Universe in this region would be prohibitively high. \nTherefore, while the heat and radiation from the regular star are advantageous for the expansion and stabilization of a Basement Universe, the lack of sufficient spacetime curvature makes it an impractical choice for its creation. \n\nWe should continue our search and conduct further experiments near other stellar candidates to find a more viable location."

This lack of sufficient energy means that there is not enough natural heat available to channel into a Basement Universe, making it extremely difficult to promote the necessary expansion and stabilization processes. Secondly, dwarf stars possess relatively low mass, resulting in minimal spacetime curvature. This insufficient warping of spacetime around the star indicates that the energy requirements to manipulate and create a Basement Universe in this region would be exceedingly high and inefficient. \nTherefore, due to the combined drawbacks of inadequate heat and insufficient spacetime curvature, dwarf stars are deemed entirely unsuitable for the creation of a Basement Universe. \n\nWe should continue our search and conduct further experiments near other stellar candidates to find a more viable location."

 ssh_vacdec.606.name: "Study Completed"
 ssh_vacdec.606.desc: "After conducting various experiments on different celestial bodies, our scientists have concluded that the most promising candidate for the Basement Universe creation would be a neutron star or pulsar. These stars are far from ideal, as their warping of spacetime is not as strong as that of a black hole, and their sheer amount of radiation will cause a higher background radiation inside the basement realm than initially planned. However, out of all the candidates, they combine the effects needed to save as much energy as possible for the creation process. \n\n§EOur next step is to develop the means of creating a more stable Basement Universe and to encase the star and utilize it for the creation process. Therefore, we should now shift our focus on §Yresearching the necessary technologies§! for such a megastructure and §Yconstructing it§! as quickly as possible before the True Vacuum reaches us. Once the Basement Universe has been created, we will have to wait until the heat inside it has cooled down and the elements have distributed and formed the first proto-planets. We will then search for a habitable zone inside it and construct a ship to move us there safely.§! \n\n§HResearching the §YBasement Gateway Technologies§! will require §Ptremendous§! amounts of research. \nWe are also advised to construct the §YBasement Gateway§! in a system far away from the Vacuum Decay, as the process of creating such basement realm will take quite some time. \n\nWe can view our current progress in the §BSituation Log§!.§!"
