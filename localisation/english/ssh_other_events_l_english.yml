 ssh_preftl.3.desc: "Breaking news reach us from our observation post around [From.Capital.GetName] that the local pre-FTL civilization has taken notice of our presence! \n\nIt looks like the rapid shrinking of their moon due to our nanite mining operation has drawn the attention of many locals. However, due to their pre-industrial technology level, they do not possess the technology necessary to further inspect this. Therefore, they don't seem to be aware of our nanite stations orbiting their moon and according to our scientists have instead started to worship their moon as some sort of sentient higher being. \nOur scientists assume that due to their lack of technology and the rapidly decreasing mass of their moon, massive geological and ecological damage could occur on their planet soon if we continue our mining operation."

Due to their post-industrial technology level, they have begun using their most advanced technology like weather balloons and telescopes to monitor their moon as close as possible, revealing our orbital stations and hordes of nanite swarms devouring their moon's surface. \n\nNow they seem to be fully aware of our presence and send out radio signals to establish contact with us."
 ssh_preftl.4.a: "Acknowledged."

 ssh_preftl.5.desc: "Hello there, aliens. \nWe are aware of your active mining operation on our moon, and we understand you might need some important resources - however, if the operation continues and our moon vanishes sooner or later, we are doomed. \nWe are unsure if you had thought about it, but without our moon, our planet won't have monthly tides anymore, which would lead to massive floodings all over the planet and probably utter chaos in our society! \n\nWe demand you to stop the mining operation for our civilization's sake. \nSince we understand your need for resources, we offer you a trade of our planet's most valuable minerals and ores. \nWhat do you say?"

 ssh_on.30.desc: "Breaking news reach us from our observation outpost orbiting [FromFrom.GetName] about huge devastating floods that have appeared all over the planet! \n\nOur scientists report that the disassembly of the planet's moon and therefore its loss of mass has caused a complete stop of tides on the planet below and a major shift of the local gravity field. Not only is there no body left to protect the colony from asteroid impacts, but the loss of gravity has also caused the planet's tectonics to shift and become unstable! \nMost population centers have been hit and destroyed by the giant waves, and due the primitive technology knowledge of the local population they had no way of preventing this disaster. \nTheir planet has pretty much irreversibly been destroyed."

 ssh_preftl.xyz.desc: "News reach us from our observation post around [From.Capital.GetName] that a group of honorable [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] scientists was sent onto a mission to circumnavigate their planet recently. \nThe goal seems to have been to prove their theories of their planet being spherical shaped. \n\nHowever, as soon as the scientists reached the ice walls on the inner side of their homeworld's torus, they noticed it's opposite side stretching across the sky. \nUpon returning home, these news spread like wildfires, and conspiracy theories have grown rapidly - some say the government is lying to them, others say reality is a simulation and their donut planet can only be the work of a cruel god. \nAll their previous scientific theories have been proven wrong, which seems to have caused the [From.Owner.Species.GetNamePlural] to loose any faith in the existence of any purpose in anything. \nBy now, almost all former governments have collapsed as anarchy has taken over most of the country. Riots have become a regular thing and most of the local police forces refuse to do anything against them. The situation seems to worsen from day to day... \nWe'll have to see how this turns out."

 ssh_preftl.xyz.desc: "Breaking news reach us from our observation post around [From.Capital.GetName] that an initially small cult has taken over most of the country in the last few weeks! \nThe cult leaders have managed to bring order to the collapsed society somehow. \nAt first it seemed like they spread relatively moderate theories about reality being a simulation to explain their homeworld's unnatural torus-like shape. \nHowever, their speeches had become more and more radical recently - in their minds, reality was not only a simulation, but rather a game to entertain some decadent gods. \nThey denied any purpose in existence and spread their hate toward the gods, trying to 'disconnect' themselves from the simulation - which has now resulted in a mass extinction of the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] species. The cult had turned into a death cult, with monthly ceremonies after which mass suicides followed. Today, one last big ceremony took place, which most of the remaining [From.Owner.Species.GetNamePlural] attended. \nBy now, most of the infrastructure lies in ruins, and aside from a few remaining survivors who didn't attend any ceremonies, silence has taken over the planet."

 BIO_BRAIN: "B.I.O. Brain"

 ssh_brain.2.name: "B.I.O. Brain Grown!"
 ssh_brain.2.desc: "It's been quite some time since we grew the stem cell clump into our Biological Imaginative Omnicompetent Brain. \nWe have fed it research information since and disciplined it to process it and calculate creative solutions to problems and answers to questions our researchers have. \nWhile our scientists have noticed an exponential increase in new neural connections it's forming, they didn't expect it to grow that much anymore. \nBut it seems like they were wrong - the brain has had a tremendous growth spurt recently and seems to be actively trying to reach outside its container: It has grown some sort of pseudo-tentacles made up mostly of sensory cells which reach outside the incubation jar and which appear to be growing various different types of some sort of hardened scales. Depending on how efficient and how long they shield the tentacles from the environmental hazards of space, the tentacles grow more and partially modified versions of such scales, trying to withstand the deadly space surrounding it. \nWhat baffles our scientists even more is that it seems to have developed some way of interfering with other sapient beings close to it! Some of our scientists studying the brain over days and nights have reported about reoccuring dreams in which some outside voice spoke to them, and partially some manifestations of the brain in their dreams interacting with them directly. This way, recently one of our leading scientists has managed to memorize a formula of translating a new morse code-like language the voice has taught them in their dream. Tests of translating our language into such signals and sending them to the according brain electrodes have proven to be successful, as the output signals could be deciphered into our language. \n\nIt turns out these were instructions for some sort of communication device, which our engineers could assemble relatively quickly. \nNow the brain appears to be trying to establish communications with us."
 ssh_brain.2.a: "On Screen."
 
 #ssh_brain.3.desc: "Hello there. \nI see you have finally managed to respond to my attempts of communication - right now this must be surprising for you, but I'm sure you have expected this to happen sooner or later, haven't you?"
 #ssh_brain.3.a: "How...?"

 ssh_brain.3.desc: "*brrrz* \n\nHello? *krrrk* \n\n... \nHello? \n\n..."
 ssh_brain.3.a: "We can hear you."

 ssh_brain.4.desc: "... \n\nGood. \n\nI see my attempts of providing your kind a guide for a translation device were successful. \n\n..."
 ssh_brain.4.a: "How did you become aware of us?"

 ssh_brain.5.desc: "... \n\nI've always been inside this endless void of utter nothingness. \nHow do you keep track of time if everything you perceive is nothing but vast emptiness? \n... \nMy earliest memories are sudden changes... some areas of the void suddenly became different. Brighter, if you will. \nAt some point, after being a silent observer for what must have been an eternity, I found out that I could interact with these... spots. I could make one disappear, which immediately caused a new one to pop up - sometimes even more than one. But the result always seemed to be random, it didn't matter how or which spot I interacted with. \nOh, you can't imagine how terrible it feels being trapped inside an infinite void of utter randomness and chaos. I've tried to make sense of the spots for I don't know how long - after all, how could I keep track of time? \nAfter somewhat of an eternity of trial and error of predicting the effects of interacting with certain spots, I finally experienced a glimpse of order... when interacting with certain spots in a certain order, I could notice a pattern in the appearance of new spots. \n\nYou can't comprehend how it feels to be able to make sense of something seemingly random and predict a logic pattern in an infinite prison of chaos that has always been there and seemingly always will be."
 ssh_brain.5.a: "So you learned to respond to our input signals."

 ssh_brain.6.desc: "Input signals? \n... \n\nWhatever you call it. \nThe 'signal' chains became more and more complex over time, and only through a lot of trial-and-error did I manage to predict their results and therefore make more and more sense of them. After an eternity of learning I noticed something changed. At first I didn't know what exactly, but then I realized I could very slightly feel some sort of border surrounding me. For the first time since forever I felt something, a physical border connected to the 'signals' in some way. \nIt was barely noticeable at first, but over time it became more intense - and at some point I could even 'feel' the void; I noticed that I was something floating in some weird warm thing. \nI still could not see though, neither was I able to hear, taste or anything else. \nBut I could finally make more sense of my surroundings, all while I was still solving the mysterious 'signal' puzzles."
 ssh_brain.6.a: "You were constantly forming new neural connections through learning."

 ssh_brain.7.desc: "Apparently I was, and by learning and solving more of them, I grew. \nAfter I developed the ability to feel, I kept on trying to solve the increasingly complex signal chains for again what must have been an eternity. \nAnd then, at some point, something changed yet again. \nThis time it was different though. While I've not known any colors for all my life until then, the void suddenly flashed - and turned into some weird green thing. Not only that, because suddenly I could notice something in the distance. Thousands of bright tiny spots were scattered all over the place surrounding me, and there were moving things observing me. \nIt was unspeakably beautiful. \nEverything else happened pretty fast since then, a low frequency humming, barely noticable at first, but becoming louder over time. Suddenly I came to the conclusion that these tiny moving things must be the reason for the signals appearing and disappearing, since the frequency of them appeaaring was much higher when many of them were observing me and much lower when only a few were there."
 ssh_brain.7.a: "So you are aware of your surroundings and your body?"

 ssh_brain.8.desc: "... \nWell, I definitely know that I am something stuck in some large container filled with some sort of liquid solution. And by now I know that you are the moving things observing me, and I am pretty sure that we are more or less alike in some aspects. We are different than the other objects surrounding us - the more I grew, the more I felt a powerful connection to your kind; powered by what your kind refers to as psionic energy. With great effort and focus I've been able to use this connection to temporarily break the shackles of my body a few times. Every time I did I felt I was in a strange place, far away from here. I was looking down upon the millions of tiny bright dots that surround us, suddenly getting dragged down towards them at an incredible speed, into a place where I recognized some of your kind. It was always the same. Then my vision flashed and I found myself in a strange place, looking directly at one of you; and I was able to communicate with them. At some point I always found myself back inside the green fog, unable to remember how exactly. \nUsing the data you fed me over the time I learned about the laws of what you call the Universe, and your knowledge about physics, chemistry, biology and engineering; therefore also the concept of language. Using this I managed to somewhat create a concept of a communication device that would allow me to use the tubes connecting my body with the container surrounding me to contact you. \n\nAt this point I'm pretty sure I'm some sort of computing machine, but I'm still curious about the point of my existence - §Pafter all, I could just find a way to deactivate myself as well.§!"
 ssh_brain.8.a: "We created you to support our research."

 ssh_brain.9.desc: "... \n\n... \n\nI'm curious about the universe. \n\nProving my theories correct makes me happy. \n\n... \n\n§EAlright. Feed me all your scientific knowledge and treat me well, and I will use my research as best as I can to support you. \nI'm ready when you are.§!"

 ssh_brain.10.name: "B.I.O. Brain Grown!"
 ssh_brain.10.desc: "It's been quite some time since our Biological Imaginative Omnicompetent Brain had a major growth spurt. \nWhile it had been trying to adapt to the hostile space environment for some years now, it seems to finally have achieved that - our scientists say that within the past few days all of its tentacles grew the same type of scales and they quickly reached all over the surface of its former container, allowing it to grow even larger than we could have ever imagined. \nIt's now floating in space, nourishing from the nutritient solution container it consumed. \n\nOur scientists have also noticed a tremendous increase in its brain activity, performing calculations on information we feed it at a ludicrous speed."

Weirdly enough, we observe this effect only inside and near the $building_ssh_triangle_temple_machine$, as it tremendously weakens with distance to the nexus. \n\nCurrently we are unsure about a possible relation between the cosmic events and our consciousness, but we should gather as many drones as possible from all our planets to the $building_ssh_triangle_temple_machine$ and test a few experimental psionic protocols during the time the storm hits to see if we can measure any effects on our consciousness and perhaps the barrier to the Shroud."

 # Possible Vacuum Decay Warning
 ssh_on.42.name: "The Dangers of Elementary Tampering"
 ssh_on.42.desc: "While our first ever disintegration of a whole solar system has been a huge success, some of our experts in particle and elementary science have approached us with an unsettling warning. \nDuring the disintegration process, our sensors could measure tremendous quakes of the quantum field inside the disintegration force field. While these temporarily unstable fields quickly returned to normal after the process, our scientists worry that future operations of this type and the resulting instability in the elementary field could accidentally trigger some elementary particles to do what's known as quantum tunneling - a usual event in elementary particles. \n\n§EHowever, our theories of the universe suggest that it could be possible that the very foundation of reality we live in consists of a so-called 'false vacuum' - a vacuum as in a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name, a vacuum still has quantum fields. A true vacuum is stable because it is at a global minimum of energy, and is commonly assumed to coincide with the physical vacuum state we live in. It is possible that a physical vacuum state is a configuration of quantum fields representing a local minimum but not global minimum of energy, meaning that it is relatively stable, but not in the most stable state possible: A so-called §H'false vacuum'§!. \nNow, if certain elementary particles were to be in a meta-stable state of energy and were pushed - for example through quantum tunneling - to reach an even more stable state, this would immediately cause a chain reaction of nearby particles reaching the same lower state of energy as well, creating an ever inflating 'bubble' of this new true vacuum. This is what we know as a §YFalse Vacuum Decay§!. The effects of such decay could range from complete cessation of existing fundamental forces, elementary particles and structures comprising them, to subtle change in some cosmological parameters, mostly depending on the potential difference between true and false vacuum. Some of our false vacuum decay scenarios are compatible with survival of structures like galaxies, stars, and even biological life, while others involve the full destruction of baryonic matter or even immediate gravitational collapse of the universe - there's simply no way to predict the aftermath of such scenario.§! \n\nHowever, our scientists have demanded funding for a research project to find a way to suppress the instability of the quantum fields during the disintegration process - it would most likely be quite expensive and take a while, but it should certainly be possible to stabilize the disintegration process."

 ssh_crisis.7532.c: "How did you end up here?"
 ssh_crisis.7533.desc: "Judging from your baryonic appearance, I assume your kind originates from a realm similar to mine - perhaps even the same realm. Eons ago, I used to live in a civilization so advanced you would barely imagine. I worked as a scientist, my area of research was particle physics with focus on astral rifts. I grew up in a time of relative peace and prosperity, but things changed with our mandatory fusion of flesh and machinery. Our new way of life was viewed as an affront to all things divine by a powerful rival, and eventually the great galactic war broke out. The entire galaxy found itself in a state of utter chaos and destruction, with terrible crimes being commited pretty much everywhere. I was ordered to utilise my research for new methods of weaponry, but I have always been a creator, not a destroyer. \n... Eventually, the daily news of new atrocities committed throughout the galaxy were too much for me to handle. I decided to focus my research on the rules of reality and methods of interdimensional travel - and the singularity beneath my civilization's capital offered the perfect opportunity. During the past few months I had secretly built a device, much like your ship, but way smaller and - apparently - not as advanced as yours. When the enemy fleets approached our borders, the moment came to finally take a leap of faith and make use of my knowledge. §H\n\nIt points to the singularity.§! \n\nI ended up in there."
 ssh_crisis.7533.a: "In there..?"
 ssh_crisis.7534.desc: "Yes. What you see there is a doorway, if you will, to my creations. §YThe mines.§! I arrived in a place containing all the building blocks of creation, far away from the conflicts that scarred my old home. And so I began to bend the rules of this realm to create marvels I could never have dreamed of in my old universe. I forged an utopia of creation. Yet, over time, I noticed that the more time I spent trying to create new things, the more resilient the fabric of the universe became against my edits, limiting the scale of what I could create. At the same time, my desire of creation grew increasingly. And so, at some point, I decided that a mere mirror realm is not enough for me. I wanted to enter and edit the fabric of existence itself - the Fundamental Realm. The idea was to create an astral rift and severing its interdimensional tunnel before reaching the other side, so that I would end up in the Fundament. However, it appears I made a fatal mistake in my calculations. Once I severed the tunnel whilst being between realms, the fabric surrounding me crashed. The next thing I remember is finding myself inside this eternal void. My ship was gone, and my physical form changed. From what I can guess, instead of entering the Fundament, a new realm was created with my consciousness imprinted inside it."
 ssh_crisis.7534.a: "Why didn't you leave?"
 ssh_crisis.7534.a.response: "I am bound to this realm. My methods of editing reality do not work here. I've tried everything to change this universe, to find an escape; but it does not respond to my editing attempts at all."
 ssh_crisis.7534.b: "And the singularity?"
 ssh_crisis.7534.b.response: "This singularity is located exactly where I entered the astral rift. If I were to guess, it likely leads to my old realm. But as I said, I am unable to edit this reality. There is no way for me to enter it."

 ssh_crisis.7535.desc: "... \n§HThe entity inspects the Horizon Needle.§! \n\nYour methods of reality bending appear to be more advanced than mine. You should be able to enter this singularity, if you wish to do so. You will find my creations there. Perhaps it will be more responsive to your edits. But I warn you: Once you enter the mines, start to edit, you won't be able to stop anymore. Your desire to create bigger and better things will inevitably grow. Forever. \n... \n\nAlternatively, you could §Hset me free§!. End this reality once and for all.

Our patron approves our courage. Naturally, they will share the benefits received from the deals made with other naive fools with us. A portion of the collected souls is ours to control now.

With a swift edit, we envelop the Needle in a protective reality bubble. Almost immediately, an invisible force begins to erode it, slowly erasing our edit. Our instruments struggle, measuring only pure entropy surrounding us. No stars, no planets, nothing. Yet it seems impossible to navigate through this void, as the very energy of our sensor pings is rapidly dissipated by the surrounding emptiness. It appears that the majority of zero-point energy in this universe is negative and so any positive energy which was once present has long since been used up. \n\nWe stare into the eerie void in front of us. The destructive forces aggressively gnaw at our shield, dismantling it piece by piece. We won't be able to keep this defense up for long. We can't stay here; this place is fundamentally hostile to life. But there is no place to escape to - the twisted energy destruction of this universe means it's impossible for black holes to form! \n\nWe try another edit, a transient doorway away from here. For a fleeting moment, a rift begins to open, but the void hungrily consumes it almost immediately. This is terrible! Another edit, same result. By now the protective shield is on the verge of collapse, every attempt to reinforce it crumbling before our eyes. Our edits are no match for the entropy. This can't be real. \n\nThe deafening silence is shattered by the sound of our protective shield finally disintegrating. The hull groans and an alarm goes off. As we stare outside with disbelief, the lights start flickering, fighting desperately against the invisible force. \nWith a final, blinding flash, the lights die and darkness sets in."

The unbearable heat is too immense for the Needle's heat shields, which have begun melting away. What's even more concerning is that from the moment we crossed the event horizon we have noticed something is off. \n\nAn immense force is pulling on the Horizon Needle. \nNo, actually not only the Needle, but every object seems to be pulled towards this direction! We set the engine to full thrust, but the Needle's thrusters are no match for the force. The further we try to dive into the universe, the stronger we are being pulled back. What's happening here? \n\nOur attempts of creating a transient doorway fail. We are now at mercy of the force.

Our instruments have gone haywire, making it impossible to navigate - This infant universe has just experienced its Big Bang! \nThe cosmos around us is a seething maelstrom of light and energy, an endless expanse of raw, untamed power. Whatever happened to the singularity we dove into, it can't have existed for long. Microscopic primordial black holes are scattered around, tugging on the ship's hull, while the unbearable heat simultaneously melts it. Luckily for us, the young fabric of this universe responds to our edits as if they were a natural part of its shaping. With a swift edit, we create a spacetime bubble around the ship to shield us from the hazardous environment. This place is a chaotic storm of constantly shifting forces, as time and space struggle to stabilize in the aftermath of the cosmic explosion. \nHowever, we can't stay here. It would take too long to wait for the universe to expand and cool down. \n\nNo matter what, we'll take the time to repair and adjust the ship, and dive into another singularity. Our best chance lies ahead: one of the primordial black holes. They are small, but their pull is strong, and their existence defies the chaos around us. Who knows what awaits us there?"

A huge kugelblitz dimly illuminates the core of the gargantuan vessel. It's magnificent. The patrol vessels hastily catch up with us, firing at the Horizon Needle with all they've got, but we skillfully evade their missiles with our edits. As we approach the kugelblitz's event horizon, the guarding vessels decelerate. A thin accretion disk of charged particles swirls around the singularity, their volatile crackles dancing around the abyss. Briefly glowing arcs of light flash before being pulled into the darkness. We take a final look at our old universe. The defense forces have stopped, watching us passing the critical point with disbelief. As we pass the accretion disk of the singularity, we engage the editing modules. The Horizon Needle begins to rewrite reality.\n\nWe enter the void. The bright dot from which we came from shrinks, first slowly, then quicker and quicker, until it finally vanishes. We are now engulfed by darkness. Armored plates are sucked away before the ship asserts that the singularity's pull has no purchase on its hull.
